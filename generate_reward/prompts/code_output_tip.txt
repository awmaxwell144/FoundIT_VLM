The output of the reward function should consist of one item:
    (1) the total reward
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".
Before "def compute_reward(...)" add import statements for any python libraries other than the standard library (this includes `import jax.numpy as jnp` if jnp is used).


The reward function will be called by the environment file. The only variables that can be referenced in compute_reward(...) are those passed in as arguments and those defined in compute_reward()

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range 
    (2) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
