Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and rewrite a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) Analyze the provided sample of state sequence. Are the values what is expected given the task?
    (2) Analyze the provided sample of reward sequence. Are the values what is expected given the task?
    (3) Other than import statements, all code should be within the function
    (4) Before "def compute_reward(...)" add import statements for any python libraries used in `compute_reward(...)` other than the standard library
    (5) The output should contain one function
    (6) In `compute_reward(...)` use only variables passed in as arguments and variables defined within the function
    (7) To improve performance, you may consider the following:
        (a) change the method of computing the reward
        (b) scale components of the reward up or down
        (c) include other aspects passed in through the argument
Please analyze the reward function and policy feedback in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code following the provided reward signature.
