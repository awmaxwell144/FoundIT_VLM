We trained a RL policy using the provided reward function code and tracked the values of the 
individual components in the reward function as well as global policy metrics such as success rates and episode lengths.
Reward function: {reward_function}
Task fitness score: {eval}
Duration: {duration}
Final reward: {final_reward}
Final state: {final_state}
Sample of reward sequence: {reward_seq}
Sample of state sequence: {state_seq}
